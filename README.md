# fullstack-web-development-learning-projects
A collection of hands-on projects built while learning full-stack web development.

This repository includes various experiments and practice apps created using Node.js, Express.js, Next.js, EJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. Each project is designed to explore different concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and gain practical experience in building modern web applications.

Whether you're learning alongside me or just exploring, this repo serves as a growing archive of my journey into full-stack development.
